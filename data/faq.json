A change room or preparation area:\n   - Preferably near to the performance area as the dancer may need to make one change of outfit during the show\n   - At least 4 square meters in size\n   - Enough light to see\n   - A clean and dry floor if it's outside\n\n2. A glass of water (plastic cups are better)\n\n3. A chair to use in the performance:\n   - Low chair (ottoman can work)\n   - NOT a tall bar stool\n   - Chair without arms\n\n4. Performance area:\n   - Make the guests sit in a semi circle around the area, where the dancer will perform\n   - Place the special lady in the centre of the semi circle, on her own chair\n   - The bigger the area, the better\n\n5. Sound system:\n   - The louder the better. If you feel it's not loud enough (louder than girls screaming), we rent out a sound system for R100\n   - Let us know what kind of input the system takes (line in, aux, Bluetooth)\n   - An iPod Docking station or kitchen radio is usually not loud enough\n\n6. Photographs:\n   - Each Dancer has their own preference, so ask them when they arrive, if you can take pictures or film the show\n\n7. Keep the bachelorette / bachelor conscious:\n   - You won't believe how many times the bride/groom is paralytic by the time the dancer arrives\n   - Get them tipsy but keep them there"

They will mingle with the girls, get them drinks, take fun photos, help where they can and create a fun vibe. The guys are all well-mannered and well-groomed."
