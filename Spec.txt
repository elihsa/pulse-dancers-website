**Pulse Dancers Website Specification**

This specification consolidates all requirements from the conversation transcripts across five files, creating a complete, standalone document for development. It covers the modern static site for a Johannesburg-based male dance entertainment group, with Netlify CMS for non-technical editing, native forms, social integrations, and future-proofing for payments/merchandise.

## Core Objectives
Modernize the existing Website X5 site (www.pulsedancers.com) into a fast, mobile-first static site hosted on Netlify (free tier). Match the current layout/content structure but refresh with contemporary design (dark/red theme, card layouts, responsive grids). Enable a non-technical assistant to edit all text/images/pricing/FAQ via browser-based CMS at `/admin`. Replace Afrihost hosting (~R100/month) with free Netlify CDN/SSL. Pre-populate with existing content; make everything editable without code changes.[1][2]

## Site Structure
| Page | Purpose | CMS-Editable Elements |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| `/` (index.html) | Hero banner, about/services, Facebook events embed, Instagram posts (2 latest via CMS URLs), testimonials (pre-populated 3), review submission form | Hero title/subtitle/CTA/image/logo, about paragraphs/services list, testimonials, Instagram post URLs, review form labels |
| `/prices.html` | Pricing table (seeded from current site: e.g., 1-Man Xpress R1800, Topless Waiter R750/hr) + notes | All rows (service/duration/price), notes text |
| `/faq.html` | Collapsible accordion (merged from FAQ doc + site content, grouped: Topless Waiters/Exotic Dancers/Bottomless Waiters/General/Games) | Groups/Q&As (add/edit/remove) |
| `/book.html` | Booking form (native Netlify Forms, live quote w/ Google Maps distance calc from Sandton City) | Form labels, booking settings (base location, free 50km, R4/km) |
| `/join.html` | New recruit form (native Netlify Forms, photo uploads) | Form labels, fields |
| `/admin/` | Netlify CMS (Decap CMS v3) dashboard | N/A (login-protected) |
| `/merch.html` | Placeholder ("Coming Soon") grid (12 sample products) | Product images/descriptions/prices (future e-commerce) |

All outbound links open in new tabs; images optimized (lazy-load, WebP/JPG/PNG).[2][3]

## Design Requirements
- **Style**: 3 homepage variants (choose 1 for production): Bold Energetic (dark/high-contrast), Elegant Minimal (white space/clean), Urban Expressive (layered visuals). Consistent site-wide: Tailwind CSS utility classes, Inter/system fonts, red accents (#FF2D55), dark bg (#0B0B0F), responsive breakpoints.
- **Layout**: Sticky nav (logo + links: Prices/FAQ/Join/Book), hero grid (text + image), card sections (about/prices/FAQ), footer (socials: IG @pulsesouthafrica, FB facebook.com/pulseSouthAfrica).
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first; grids stack to 1-col <900px; tables/accordions collapse.
- **Performance**: <2s load; no bloat (no heavy libs beyond Tailwind/Decap CMS).[4][1]

## CMS Configuration (Netlify CMS/Decap v3)
- **Backend**: Git Gateway (main branch), media: `images/uploads`.

## Forms Implementation
### Booking Form (`/book.html`)
Native Netlify Forms submission to `bookings@pulsedancers.com` (subject: "[Date] - [Event Type] - [Area] - [Name]").
- **Fields** (compact 2-col grid, stack mobile):
  | Row | Fields |
  |-----|--------|
  | Contact | Full Name/Email/Phone/City (required) |
  | Event | Event Type (dropdown: Bachelorette/Birthday/Girls Night/Corporate/Other), Date/Time (required) |
  | Guests | Guests (dropdown: <10/10-20/20-40/40+; auto-suggest performers: 1 if <20, 2+ if ≥20 w/ note "1 per 20 guests"), Service (dropdown matching prices), Performers (number) |
  | Location | Radio: Exact Address (Google Places autocomplete) / Area (geocode suburb); calc driving distance round-trip from Sandton City |
  | Details | Notes (textarea) |
- **Live Quote**: Performance (service × performers from prices.json) + Travel (max(0, km-50) × R4/km; editable via CMS) = Total (updates on change).
- **Validation/Submit**: Honeypot spam, required fields; post-submit confirmation.[5]

### Join Form (`/join.html`)

- **Validation**: Min age 18, required photos; auto-resize uploads <1.5MB.[5]

## Integrations & Features

## Tech Stack & Deployment

## Pre-Populated Content
- **Homepage**: "Fulfill your Fantasies" hero; services (Male Strippers/Topless Waiters/etc.); 3 testimonials (Leanne/Megan/Sam).

## Future-Proofing
- **Payments**: Structure for Stripe/PayFast (CMS-editable links/buttons).
- **Merch**: `/merch` scaffold (grid ready for Snipcart).
- **Blog**: Add markdown posts for SEO (e.g., "Top Gauteng Bachelorette Venues").[1]
